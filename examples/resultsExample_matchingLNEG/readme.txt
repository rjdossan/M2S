This directory contains output files of using the method for matching the test sets SLNEG provided.
The files "matchedRefData_idx" and "matchedTargetData_idx"are the output of the method.
The two columns of e.g. "matchedRefData_idx" were copied (without header) to the respective original 
input files and pasted into columns A and B. The rows of the datasheet were then sorted according to 
column A (the one with numbers and empty values). 
The files "matched and already sorted..." contain the result of that operation. The rows in the bottom
where column A is empty did not match and can be deleted.
