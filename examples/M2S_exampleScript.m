%% Load reference and target features of sets to match 
% These are two data files containing 3 columns without headers, only values for each feature, in this order: RT, MZ, FI. 
% NOTE: RT = retention time median;  MZ = mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio median; FI = Feature Intensity median
% RT should be in minutes. If it is in seconds, divide it by 60;
% If there is no feature intensity use a column with ones or random values.

%% Load the data

datasetName = "LPOS"; % {"LNEG","LPOS"}

% NOTE: there are two Plasma Lipid examples (ESI- and ESI+), each with two
% datasets that can be matched

%% Set thresholds for matching all features 
% Try running it with default settings as below, to see the major trends.

% NOTES on setting thresholds:
% Thresholds define the maximum acceptable inter-dataset shift for each dimension (RT, MZ, log10FI). 
% You can define "horizontal line" fixed thresholds by using only "intercept" values, and setting "slope" to zero.
% These are equivalent to defining a fixed m/z.
% You can define "diagonal line" relative thresholds by using also "slope" values.
% These are equivalent to defining a relative m/z (kind of a ppm threshold value)
% HINT: the function below helps to calculate an intercept and slope in one of the dimensions:
%[RTMZFI_intercept,RTMZFI_slope] = M2S_calculateInterceptSlope() % to define it with the mouse on a figure
%[RTMZFI_intercept,RTMZFI_slope] = M2S_calculateInterceptSlope(startPoint,endPoint) % to insert two points manually

%% Procedure part 2: Calculate penalisation scores for each match
%%*************************************************************************

%% Find neighbours, the RT/MZ/log10FI trends, and the residuals - SETTINGS OPTIONAL
% - Find the inter-dataset shifts in RT/MZ/log10FI, and  use it to 
% calculate the residuals (distance to those shift curves).
% - The method to find RT/MZ/FI shift trends uses subsets of features closest to each feature (the "neighbors").
% For a reference feature, its shift is the median shift of its neighbours.
% - The number of neighbors is not critical and can be defined by a percentage of the total of
% features in the refSet (e.g. 0.05) or by a specific number (e.g. 25). The
% less neighbours the more detailed is the modeling (less linear).
% - The neighbor method to calculate trends can be:
%       - "cross", finds neighbours of a feature in RT, MZ, FI individually.
%       Different neighbours are found in each of these dimensions.
%       -(default) "circle", finds neighbours by Euclidean distance using
%       simultaneously RT and MZ (but not FI). "Circle" does not subtract the 
%       trend from FI, only yelds the log10FI difference between target and ref.
% - The shifts can be individual points for each ref feature, or additionally
% smoothed using a robust loess 
%
% SETTINGS POSSIBILITIES
% opt.neighbours.nrNeighbors = 0.01; %as a percentage of the number of features in refSet  
% opt.neighbours.nrNeighbors = 21; % as a specific number of neighbours
% opt.calculateResiduals.neighMethod = 'circle'; %{'cross','circle'}
% opt.pctPointsLoess = 0.1; options are 0 (no loess) or ]0,1], use for the 
% loess a percentage of the total number of points (size(refSet,1)).
% plotTypeResiduals = 1 % Options are 0 (no plot), 1 (default), 2 (extra)
%
% NOTE: M2S_calculateResiduals_v2 fits a curve on RT vs RT or MZ vs MZ (not
% the RTdist vs RT or the MZdist vs MZ.

if datasetName == "LNEG"
    opt.neighbours.nrNeighbors = 21;
    opt.calculateResiduals.neighMethod = 'circle';
    opt.pctPointsLoess = 0;% no loess
    plotTypeResiduals = 1
    [Residuals_X,Residuals_trendline] = M2S_calculateResiduals(refSet,targetSet,Xr_connIdx,Xt_connIdx,opt.neighbours.nrNeighbors, opt.calculateResiduals.neighMethod,opt.pctPointsLoess,plotTypeResiduals)
elseif datasetName == "LPOS"
    opt.neighbours.nrNeighbors = 0.01;
    opt.calculateResiduals.neighMethod = 'cross';

end



%% Adjust the residuals
% - The residuals are in different units and need to be standardised
% to be combined into penalisation scores for each match.
% This is achieved by dividing the residuals by their median+3*MAD, or by
% a user-defined residual value.
% After this division, the value of the residual on that point is 1, so it
% is easy to visualise the relevance of each of the dimension's residuals (RT/MZ/log10FI).
%
% SETTINGS POSSIBILITIES
% opt.adjustResiduals.residPercentile = NaN 
% Automatic determination (median + 3*MAD) using threshold point method. Different value for each dimension. 
%    
% opt.adjustResiduals.residPercentile = [0.05,0.004,1.2]; 
% Set threshold points using residual values. These selected residual values become = 1 
% (residuals can be seen in previous figure "Residuals for RT and MZ")  


if datasetName == "LNEG"
    opt.adjustResiduals.residPercentile = [0.1,0.01,1.5];
    [adjResiduals_X,residPercentile] = M2S_adjustResiduals(refSet,targetSet,Residuals_X,opt.adjustResiduals.residPercentile);
elseif datasetName == "LPOS"
    [adjResiduals_X,residPercentile] = M2S_adjustResiduals(refSet,targetSet,Residuals_X,NaN);
end


%% Adjust the weight of each dimension (RT, MZ, log10FI), get penalisation scores
% - The penalisation scores for each match are the squared root of the sum 
% of squares of the weighted residuals. Many times it is desired that log10FI has weight 0.
% The highest penalty scores are attributed to the worst matches
%
% opt.weights.W = [1,1,0]; % (Default) equal weight for RT and MZ, not using FI
% opt.weights.W = [2,1,0]; % different weights
% opt.weights.W = [1,1,1]; % equal weight
%
% [penaltyScores] = M2S_defineW_getScores(refSet,targetSet,adjResiduals_X,opt.weights.W,1)
% [penaltyScores] = M2S_defineW_getScores(refSet,targetSet,adjResiduals_X); W = [1,1,0]

if datasetName == "LNEG"
    opt.weights.W = [1,1,1]; % equal weight
    [penaltyScores] = M2S_defineW_getScores(refSet,targetSet,adjResiduals_X,opt.weights.W,1); 
elseif datasetName == "LPOS"

    [penaltyScores] = M2S_defineW_getScores(refSet,targetSet,adjResiduals_X,opt.weights.W,1);
end

%% Decide the best of the multiple matches 
% - Recursive method for a multiple-match cluster at a time. In
% each iteration it collects the (best) match with the lowest penalisation 
% score, until there are no more selections to do in that cluster.
% NOTE:you can visualise the decomposition of clusters with multiple matches 
% by giving minNrNodesToPlot a small value, e.g. minNrNodesToPlot = 4.
% plotNetOrNot = 1; % 0/1 plots global network of all matches colored by penalisation scores.
% minNrNodesToPlot = 3
%
% [eL,eL_INFO,CC_G1]= M2S_decideBestMatches(refSet, targetSet, Xr_connIdx,Xt_connIdx, penaltyScores, plotNetOrNot, minNrNodesToPlot)
[eL,eL_INFO,CC_G1]= M2S_decideBestMatches(refSet, targetSet, Xr_connIdx,Xt_connIdx, penaltyScores);

%%*************************************************************************
%% Procedure part 3: find false positives (tighten thresholds)
%%*************************************************************************
% - The thresholds set initially are linear, and may not adapt well to the
% curved inter-dataset shifts. Here we define tighter thresholds adapting to curvature.
% - This will delete the matches with largest residuals than the value of a
% median plus N * the MAD of a quantity (scores, residuals, etc)
%
% - Methods:
% 'none' - does not apply new thresholds
% 'scores' - threshold is set at the scores median + N * MAD(scores)
% 'byBins' - residuals of each dimension divided into regions and thresholds set in each
% 'trend_mad' - thresholds are set around the inter-dataset shift value, for each dimension separately
% 'residuals_mad' - (Default) thresholds are set for each of the residuals separately
% NOTE1: scores method finds poor matches based on the weighted scores across all dimensions, while the
% other methods consider matches as poor even if they are outside threshold on a single dimension
% NOTE2: trend_mad and residuals_mad are calculated differentely and have
% different plots, but yield the same results
% opt.falsePos.methodType = 'scores'; {'none','scores','byBins','trend_mad','residuals_mad'} 
% Example:
% opt.falsePos.nrMad = 5;
% plotOrNot = 1;
% [eL_final, eL_final_INFO] =M2S_findPoorMatches(eL,refSet,targetSet,opt.falsePos.methodType,opt.falsePos.nrMad,plotOrNot);
% Example with default settings - methodType = trend_mad; nrMad = 5:
% [eL_final, eL_final_INFO] = M2S_findPoorMatches(eL,refSet,targetSet); 

if datasetName == "LNEG"
    opt.falsePos.methodType = 'trend_mad'; %{'none','scores','byBins','trend_mad','residuals_mad'} 
    opt.falsePos.nrMad = 5;
    plotOrNot = 1;
    [eL_final, eL_final_INFO] = M2S_findPoorMatches(eL,refSet,targetSet,opt.falsePos.methodType,opt.falsePos.nrMad,plotOrNot);
elseif datasetName == "LPOS"
    opt.falsePos.methodType = 'scores'; %{'none','scores','byBins','trend_mad','residuals_mad'}

% 0. Run the functions above to save two tables of "M2S_matchedData_idx" (ref and target).
% 1. Copy 'M2S_matchedRefData_idx' and 'matchedTargetData_idx' to the datasheets (e.g. Excel, csv, etc)
%    of ref and target you want to match, and paste them along the variables
% 2. Sort the variables in ascending order of the NUMERICAL indices (min to max), so the row order becomes 1, 2, 3, etc. The empty indices will be sent to the end. 
% 3. Delete the data for variables with empty indices (these features do not match anything)
% 4. Check there is the same number of variables in both datasets and these
%    have similar (matched) RT and MZ (and FI?). Check that the MZRT_string matches
%    the retention time and m/z of the corresponding features.
